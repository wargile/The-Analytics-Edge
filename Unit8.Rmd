# Lecture 
## 8.1 Airline Revenue Management : An Introduction to Linear Optimization 
Suppose that, as in the previous video, regular seats cost $617 and discount seats cost $238. We are selling 166 seats. The demand for regular seats is 150 and the demand for discount seats is 150. 
```{r}
CostReg <- 617 
CostDis <- 238 
Nticket <- 166 
DemandReg <- 150 
DemandDis <- 150 
#How many discount seats should we sell?
NDis <- Nticket - DemandReg
#What would our total revenue be, for both regular and discount seats, assuming that we have a full plane?
TotalRev <- DemandReg * CostReg + NDis * CostDis 
TotalRev
```
